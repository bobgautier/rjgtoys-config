Easy way to set up a list of places to try by default

    A default set of path *templates*, and you provide
    a set of values for the variables (e.g. 'name')

    [ './{name}.conf', '~/.{name}.conf', '/etc/{name}.conf' ]

Have the --config option replace the entire search list?

Don't force people to use Pydantic?
