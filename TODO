Improve the way defaults and views are applied:

The view mapping that applies to the data in a file
should be the mapping that is defined by the file or
by something it includes as a default.

This is so that I can include defaults that use a different mapping
to the one I'm using, yet get them applied sensibly.

Example:

   a: 1

   defaults:
     b: 2
     __view__:
       user:
         setting: b
         param: c
    __view__:
      user:
        setting: a

Where does the top-level view get its 'param' from?   I think I need a rule that
attributes that are not mentioned are mapped 'directly', by name (so param=param)

Easy way to set up a list of places to try by default

    A default set of path *templates*, and you provide
    a set of values for the variables (e.g. 'name')

    [ './{name}.conf', '~/.{name}.conf', '/etc/{name}.conf' ]

Have the --config option replace the entire search list?

Don't force people to use Pydantic?
