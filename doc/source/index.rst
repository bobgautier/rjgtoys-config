rjgtoys.config: A modular configuration data interface
======================================================

This package provides a simple and modular way for programs to access configuration
data.

The word 'modular' in the description refers to the way in which `rjgtoys.config`
allows independent modules or packages to define the structure of their configuration
data, whilst retrieving that data from a single combined source.

There is no need for a single, centralised definition of the 'config file format',
nor do the individual modules or packages define the structure even of parts of
the 'config file'.
